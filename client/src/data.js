But the thing is, He is ugly. I tell Him he looks good to not hurt his feelings and he trusted me. The thing is, I don't love him at all. I don't think he looks good neither. Now he is broken, sad, and she's feeling lonely. ",

He chooses to stick by me no matter the fuck happens. I couldnâ€™t handle his patience and care for me. Iâ€™m in a loop of trying to be a better person but nooooâ€¦what even holds me back? I just being selfish. Ugh this hurts man. I wanna unalive myself sometimes.",
